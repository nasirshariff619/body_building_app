# Body Building Application
 
## Contents

## Brief
 My overall objective during the completin of this project is to create a CRUD(create, Read, update and delete) application with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training.

 This enables the trainers to assess our capabilty of using the technologies and concepts that have been taught to us.

 ### Requirements And Constraints For Minimum Viable Product
 The requirements set out below are what's needed to create a mininum viable product for our project.
 The requirements of the project are as follows:

* A kanban board for the aid of creating and tracking project.
* A relational database, of atleast 2 tables, used to store data persistently for the project. A modelled relationship is also required between these two databases.
* Clear documentation from a design phase describing the architecture used for the project. Along with this a detailed risk assessment.
* A functional CRUD application created in python which meet requirements set out on kanban board.
* Fully designed test suites for the application being created, as well as automated tests for the validation of the application. High test coverage must be provided in the backend. Consistent reports and evidence must be provided to support a TDD(Test Driven Development) approach.
* A functioning front-end website and integrates API's(Application Programming Interface), using Flask.
* Code fully integrated into a Version Control System using the Feature-Branch model which will subsequentkly be built through a CI(Continuous Integration) server and deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine.

The constraints which regard the technology used must utilise the technology discussed during training, which are as follows:

* Kanban Board: Trello or an equivalent Kanban Board.
* Database: GCP SQL Server or other Cloud Hosted managed Database.
* Programming language: Python.
* Unit Testing with Python (Pytest).
* Integration Testing with Python (Selenium).
* Front-end: Flask (HTML).
* Version Control: Git.
* CI Server: Jenkins.
* Cloud server: GCP Compute Engine.
